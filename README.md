- 🤖 AI-generated interview questions based on your role
- 📝 Input your answers directly in the app
- ✅ Get real-time evaluation of your answers
- 💡 Receive AI-suggested better answers for continuous learning
- 🔁 Continue the interview with multiple rounds

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Streamlit** – for building the interactive web UI
- **LangChain** – for chaining LLM-based question generation, evaluation, and answer improvement
- **LLMs** – used through LangChain chains for generating questions, evaluating responses, and suggesting improvements
